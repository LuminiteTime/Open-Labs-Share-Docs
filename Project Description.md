## Project Description
---

***Open Labs Share***Â is a peer-to-peer educational platform that connects experts with learners through hands-on, practical learning experiences. Here's what it offers:

- **Expert-Created Content**: Subject-matter experts design step-by-step laboratory exercises focused on real-world applications
- **Practical Learning**: Students complete these labs to develop skills they can immediately apply in professional settings
- **Community Feedback**: A peer review system where learners evaluate and provide feedback on each other's completed assignments
- **Knowledge Sharing Ecosystem**: A collaborative environment where practical knowledge is actively exchanged among community members

Essentially, it's like combining the practical approach of a university lab with the collaborative feedback of platforms like GitHub or Stack Overflow.

## Competitive Advantages
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasis on real-world application sets it apart from theory-heavy platforms
- **Peer Review System**: Creates engagement and community while reducing expert workload
- **Expert Monetization**: Attractive proposition for subject-matter experts to share knowledge profitably


## Project Analysis

### Key features:
-  Publishing lab materials (Markdown document with assets)
- Submitting finished work in PDF format.
- Ability to leave feedback on somebody's work

#### Publishing lab materials
Lab materials are represented in web page as rendered Markdown documents with exact practice topic. When upload a new lab, user should send main Markdown document with all required assets (image files) names exactly as they are referred in document.
Each lab should be a list of steps required to do / create / build something. All labs should be practically oriented. Consequently, each lab should have afterward hands-on exercises (theoretical questions, practical tasks).

#### Submits of homework
Each student must be able to do a homework (set of exercises) after the laboratory. In order to have feedback, student may submit a finished work in **PDF** format to a platform. Each submission is connected to the exact laboratory and its set of exercises. 

#### Submit evaluating
The author of the laboratory or people that have finished the laboratory should be able to check new homeworks from other people.

> [!note] User story on submit evaluation
> **As a** laboratory author or student who completed a lab 
> **I want to** review and provide feedback on submitted homework 
> **So that** I can help other learners improve their practical skills and contribute to the learning community
> 
> **Acceptance Criteria**:
> 1. GIVEN I'm on the control panel, WHEN I click "Review Submissions", THEN I see labs I'm eligible to review with submission counts (I see the cards of labs I have already submitted and number of available homeworks under each title.)
> 2. GIVEN I select a specific lab, WHEN I view available submissions as cards, THEN I see homework cards with student name, submission date, and title
> 3. GIVEN I click "Review Submission" button placed on submission card, WHEN the review interface opens, THEN I see the PDF rendered clearly with a feedback form alongside (on the right)
> 4. GIVEN I'm writing feedback, WHEN I submit my review, THEN the student receives notification and I see confirmation
> 5. GIVEN there are no submissions available, WHEN I access the review section, THEN I see a helpful message explaining the situation
